## Description

Fitness Tracker is a dynamic NoSQL app used to track Cardio and Resistance workouts. Users can access, track and update their workouts multiple times a day to track their progress over a 7 day period. 

Users are initially presented with a page that reviews their most recent workout. The Workout Dashboard also presents the stats for weights lifted and time spent exercising. This application was deployed to MongoDB Atlas and Heroku.
